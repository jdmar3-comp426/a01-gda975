            <h2>What Were The 12 Labors?</h2>
            <p>Heracles waged a victorious war against the kingdom of Orchomenus in 
                Boeotia and married Megara, daughter of Creon, king of Thebes, but he 
                killed her and their children in a fit of madness sent by Hera and, consequently, 
                was obliged to become the servant of Eurystheus. It was Eurystheus who imposed upon 
                Heracles the famous Labours, later arranged in a cycle of 12, usually as follows:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The slaying of the Nemean lion, whose skin he thereafter wore.</li>
                <li>The slaying of the nine-headed Hydra of Lerna.</li>
                <li>The capture of the elusive hind (or stag) of Arcadia.</li>
                <li>The capture of the wild boar of Mount Erymanthus.</li>
                <li>The cleansing, in a single day, of the cattle stables of King Augeas of Elis.</li>
                <li>The shooting of the monstrous man-eating birds of the Stymphalian marshes.</li>
                <li>The capture of the mad bull that terrorized the island of Crete.</li>
                <li>The capture of the man-eating mares of King Diomedes of the Bistones.</li>
                <li>The taking of the girdle of Hippolyte, queen of the Amazons.</li>
                <li>The seizing of the cattle of the three-bodied giant Geryon, who ruled the island Erytheia 
                    (meaning red) in the far west.</li>
                <li>The bringing back of the golden apples kept at the worldâ€™s end by the Hesperides.</li>
                <li>The fetching up from the underworld of the triple-headed dog Cerberus, guardian of its gates.</li>
