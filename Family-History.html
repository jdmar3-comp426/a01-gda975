            <h2>Who Were Hercules' Parents?</h2>
            <p>Hercules had a complicated family tree. According to legend,
               his father was Zeus, ruler of all the gods on Mount Olympus and 
               all the mortals on earth, and his mother was Alcmene, the granddaughter 
               of the hero Perseus. (Perseus, who was also said to be one of Zeusâ€™ 
               sons, famously beheaded the snake-haired Gorgon Medusa.)</p>
            <h3>Zeus</h3>

                As the chief Greek deity, Zeus is considered the ruler, protector, and 
                father of all gods and humans. Zeus is often depicted as an older man 
                with a beard and is represented by symbols such as the lightning bolt 
                and the eagle.</p>
